# Honours
University Honours Project, procedurally generated dungeons

This Unity project designs levels that aim to replicate the kind of key and lock dungeon layouts found in GBC era 2D Zelda games.
The aim of the project was to see if players could identify procedurally generated levels from human-designed ones.
The result of the project is that players cannot reliably identify procedurally generated levels.
